    Apply median-based clipping and feature expansion to training and test data.

    Centers each feature by its median (computed from the training set) and splits 
    deviations into positive and negative components. This doubles the number of 
    features and allows the model to capture asymmetric behavior above and below 
    the median.

    Results in two columns: one for values above the median (clipped at 0) and

    Build a continuous-feature Bayesian stacking model in PyMC.

    Constructs a hierarchical Bayesian model that learns feature-dependent 
    stacking weights for combining predictions from multiple candidate models 
    (e.g., BART, HBNN, GP). The weights are learned based on pointwise LOO 
    log predictive densities (`lpd_point`) and depend on continuous input features 
    provided in `X`. Optionally computes test-set weights for new inputs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : ndarray
        Training feature matrix (N × D) used to model the dependence of stacking weights.
    X_test : ndarray
        Test feature matrix (N* × D) for evaluating stacking weights on unseen data.

    Fit a continuous-feature Bayesian stacking model and combine posterior
    predictive draws from BART, HBNN, and GP using posterior draws of the
    stacking weights.

    The stacking model is trained on pointwise log predictive densities
    (LPDs) from the base models and covariates derived from `x_train` and
    `x_pred`. Posterior draws of the test-set weights are then used to form
    draw-by-draw stacked predictions, propagating uncertainty from both the
    base model predictions and the stacking weights.

    Parameters
    ----------
    BART_post_pred, HBNN_post_pred, GP_post_pred : array-like

    x_pred : array-like
        Test covariates at which stacking weights are evaluated.
    lpd_BART, lpd_HBNN, lpd_GP : array-like
        Pointwise log predictive densities for the three base models on the
        training data, each of shape (N_train,).
    tau_mu : float, default 1.0
        Prior scale for the mean function in the stacking model.
    tau_sigma : float, default 0.5
        Prior scale for the variance function in the stacking model.
    draws : int, default 1000
        Number of posterior draws for the stacking model.
    chains : int, default 4
        Number of MCMC chains.
    random_seed : int, default 42
        Random seed used for posterior sampling and draw alignment.

    Returns
    -------
    trace : arviz.InferenceData
        Posterior samples from the stacking model, including the test-set
        stacking weights `w_test`.
    y_stack_draws : ndarray
        Stacked posterior predictive draws with shape (S_stack, N_test).
    w_draws : ndarray
        Posterior draws of the stacking weights with shape (S_w, N_test, 3).

    Notes
    -----
    Base-model posterior predictive arrays and stacking-weight draws may
    contain different numbers of samples (e.g., different chains or draws).
    All arrays are first reshaped to (S, N_test). A common number of samples
    `S_stack` is then chosen as the minimum across all sources, and draws are
    randomly sampled (with replacement if needed) so that predictions and
    weights can be paired draw-by-draw when forming the stacked predictions.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the stacking model returns a number of weights different from the
        expected three base models.
